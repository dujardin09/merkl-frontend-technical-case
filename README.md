This case is destined to front end software engineers to validate skills such as state management, code architecture, git usage, merkl libraries usage and providing feedback.

# ðŸ“’ Case

Make a minimal version of the merkl app where a user can connect, switch chains, check their token balances and filter opportunities on selected tokens + 1 or more other filters/sorting of your choice.

To achieve this you have to use merklâ€™s [dappkit](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/dappkit) & [api package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@merkl/api?activeTab=readme), which include all the components and functions to handle wallets & fetch merklâ€™s resources.

# âœ… Requirements

- [x]  For each opportunity, show at least the opportunityâ€™s name, apr and tvl.
- [x]  Display a maximum of 5 of the userâ€™s tokens sorted by dollar value.
- [x]  Handle wallet connection & switching chains
- [x]  Do not restrict viewing and filtering to connected users

### ðŸ¤© Bonus ideas

- [x]  Handle pagination with a static/dynamic page size of your choice
- [x]  Handle SSR (being able to share a link to a filtered view)
- [ ]  Imagine a filter that we donâ€™t have yet on [app.merkl.xyz](http://app.merkl.xyz)
- [ ]  Tweak the theme of the app or add a theme selector

# ðŸš” Modalities

- Start from this basic remix app which includes the dappkit w/ a default configuration
- Submit a pull request
- Try not to spend more than 3 hours to complete it
